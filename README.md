##Assignment Description

Write bootstrap code to illustrate the central limit theorem in R markdown and push the result to GitHub. Use a normal distribution with two different sample sizes and an exponential distribution with two different sample sizes. Correct code alone is insufficient. Please also comment on the code and explain the results. For help, see the lotsa.medians function in unit 2. The deliverable is a link to a GitHub repo containing the code.
